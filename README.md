Online Library Management System is a system which maintains the information about the books present in the library, their authors, the members of library to whom books are issued, library staff and all. This is very difficult to organize manually. Maintenance of all this information manually is a very complex task. Owing to the advancement of technology, organization of an Online Library becomes much simple. The Online Library Management has been designed to computerize and automate the operations performed over the information about the members, book issues and returns and all other operations. This computerization of library helps in many instances of its maintenances. It reduces the workload of management as most of the manual work done is reduced Library Management System in which we can perform all CRUD operations, in addition to advanced search, book issuing, Serialization, and Deserialization CRUD is an acronym for CREATE, READ, UPDATE and DELETE which are basic functions of persistent storage. CRUD operations can use forms or an interface view to retrieve and return data from a database. Reads the table records based on the primary key within the input parameter Serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream. Deserialization is the reverse process where the byte stream is used to recreate the actual Java object in memory. This mechanism is used to persist the object.

The different concepts used here are classes and objects , collections, array list ,searching characters and substring in a string and serialization and deserialization Then moving to the project we have breakdown our work in to 6 tasks and we have layed our roadmap through this tasks and performed out project so talking about the tasks Create a blueprint to store Book details (getting started ) Implement searching for books based on their name or authors name (addition and deletion of book details ) Emulate admin login session via the command line (searching)

Implement the functionality to issue a book for a user (issue books)

Implement serialization and deserialization to store the data in encrypted format in files (serialization and deserialization using files)

Implementing GUI framework using JFrame of applets library

The project will be a typical command line application in Java.

     We'll be accepting data (book and user details) to be stored.
     
     We'll be adding the functionality to retrieve book details.
     
     The admin login session will be emulated via the command line. Only during the admin login session can a user be issued a book.
    
    All of the data will be stored in encrypted format in text files to escape the initial volatile nature of the application.
